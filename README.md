### Learning Goals:
The aim of this exercise is to practice and understand the concept of `state`.
For now, we will be only looking forward, as how `state's ` work, with `class-component` in react.
With respect to how `state's` work with `functional-component` -> we will go through that in upcoming lessons. But, just to give a headstart, `hooks` are used, in order to maintain `state's` using `functional-component` in react. 
We will see `hooks` in detail in upcoming lessons.

### Steps to follow:

1. Clone this repository.

2. On your terminal go inside `exercise-lab-state-boilerplate` directory and use the following command: `npm install`.This command install's all the packages to your system that this project is using.
Here is a link to get a better understanding of what and how exactly the above command works.

3. Once everything is ready, you can type `npm start` -> inorder to run the application. You should be able to see a server running and see the output as shown below:
